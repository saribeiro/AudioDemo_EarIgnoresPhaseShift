# Repository Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to make Python based audio demos for educational purposes. It is intended for people wishing to use ready made demonstrations to teach core concepts in audio, signal processing, physics, electronics and generally anything having to do with these topics.

# Contents
The contents of this repository will be updated as I create new demonstrations or generate more Python code for each demonstration. Here is a current list of folder content.

## Audio Phase Shifting Demo
Demonstrates that phase shifting the individual frequencies of a signal produces no difference in perceived sound even though the time domain representations look very different.
